i-league-table-scraper (http://i-league-table-generator.herokuapp.com/)

@nischalhp and I manage r/bengalurufc on Reddit and we need a nice neat way by
which we can get the tables (manually updating them is called HELL) so wrote
this small scraper.

To use:
  virtualenv env
  source env/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python scrape.py

Also, Happy Ugadi!
